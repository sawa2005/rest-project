# Portfolio REST API

REST API created to manage a database that stores my personal portfolio's information.

## Description

This REST API was created as part of my project in the university course, Web Development III and was based on a simpler API created for a earlier assignment in the same course. The purpose of the API is to manage a database that stores my portfolio's information and act as a CRUD interface. This means that this API can both Create, Read, Update and Delete data from the database remotely. The API can be used via a client like Advanced Rest Client or Postman as well as from a website with the help of Fetch API which is the way I am using it.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* To install this API for yourself simply clone the below command and upload the files onto a web server.

```
git clone https://github.com/sawa2005/restprojekt.git
```
